# Python Sales Forecasting from Email Marketing Campaign

This portfolio project simulates the performance of an email marketing campaign â€” developed entirely in **Python** as part of a business analytics and marketing strategy learning module.

The analysis is based on a simulated campaign for *TechDynamics*, a technology company launching an innovative smartwatch.  
The project estimates potential sales generated from an email campaign based on user-defined parameters such as **contacts reached**, **open rate**, **click-through rate (CTR)**, and **conversion rate**.

---

## Project Goals

- Simulate a complete **email marketing campaign funnel**  
- Estimate potential **sales outcomes** based on marketing performance metrics  
- Understand the **impact of engagement rates** on final conversions  
- Translate a **business logic problem** into a Python programming workflow  
- Demonstrate the connection between **marketing KPIs** and **revenue potential**

---

## Key Techniques

- Input validation and error handling (`try/except`)  
- Modular programming with reusable functions (`read_int`, `parse_rate`, `compute_sales`, `print_report`)  
- Mathematical simulation using campaign conversion formulas  
- Formatted output reporting with intermediate KPIs (opens, clicks, conversions)  
- Application of fundamental Python concepts (variables, conditionals, functions, loops)

## Executive Summary

This Python program enables marketers and analysts to estimate the number of potential sales resulting from an email marketing campaign.  
By entering campaign parameters (number of contacts, open rate, CTR, and conversion rate) the simulator computes intermediate performance indicators and final sales forecasts.

The project demonstrates how simple programming logic can be used to **quantify marketing performance** and **support data-driven decision-making** in digital campaigns.  
It bridges the gap between **marketing intuition** and **technical analytics**, showcasing how code can simulate real-world business processes.
